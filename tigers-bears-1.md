# Tigers and Bears

## Tigers

### Where They Are Found
Tigers are found across Asia, from the Siberian taiga to mangrove swamps in India and Bangladesh, and tropical forests in Southeast Asia.

### What They Eat
Tigers are solitary hunters that prey on deer, wild boar, water buffalo, and other ungulates. They sometimes take livestock when wild prey is scarce.

### What They Think About Global Warming
*"Rising seas threaten our mangroves, and shrinking forests push us closer to people. We are stripes in a vanishing jungle, and the heat presses closer each year."*

## What Tigers Say

Trump sucks. No Kings!

## Bears

### Where They Are Found
Bears live across North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Different species occupy habitats ranging from Arctic sea ice (polar bears) to dense forests (brown and black bears) and high mountains (spectacled bears).

### What They Eat
Bears are generally omnivores, with diets varying by species and season. They may eat plants, berries, fish, insects, small mammals, or carrion. Polar bears rely almost entirely on seals.

### What They Think About Global Warming
*"The ice melts beneath my paws, the rivers warm too soon, and the berries ripen out of season. The world changes faster than I can roam."*

*"Forests shrink, seas rise, and humans move closer. My stripes fade into shrinking cover, and the warmth of the earth feels less like life and more like loss."*

## Bears (Revised)

### Where They Are Located (Revised)
Bears can be found across multiple continents, from Arctic ice sheets and alpine peaks to temperate forests and tropical mountain ranges.
